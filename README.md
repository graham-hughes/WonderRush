# WonderRush
I designed, built, and self published WonderRush while interning at the educational robotics company Wonder Workshop. /n
This was my first major project, before I had taken any formal CS course, so much of the code is not up to my current standards. 

## Function
WonderRush has four unique, themed play modes: race-car, horse, tank, and UFO. Race-car comes free, while the remaining modes are unlocked through a single in app purchase. [Here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wonder-rush/id1017382463?mt=8) is a link to the app on the iTunes store, where it currently has 4.5 stars and over 50,000 downloads.

## Credits
Thanks to Orion Elenzil and Leisen Huang for mentoring me while I worked on this.
